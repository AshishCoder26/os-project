⚡ Energy-Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm
📌 Overview
The Energy-Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm optimizes CPU scheduling while reducing power consumption. Unlike traditional scheduling techniques that prioritize performance metrics like throughput and response time, this algorithm integrates power-awareness using Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and workload prediction techniques.

🌟 Features
Optimized CPU Scheduling: Balances performance and power efficiency.
Dynamic Frequency Scaling: Adjusts CPU frequency based on workload.
Energy Consumption Tracking: Monitors energy usage per process.
Load Balancing: Ensures fair task distribution.
Multi-Core Optimization: Efficiently utilizes multi-core processors.
Comparative Analysis: Benchmarks performance against traditional algorithms.
